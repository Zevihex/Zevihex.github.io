      <h1 id="aboutme">About Me</h1>
      <h2 class="aboutmeh2">Bio</h2>
      <h3 class="aboutmeh3">I love gaming, listening to music, and learning in general. I am currently in college studying IT software development which is going well so far.
      I love learning and programming on my own as well. Hopefully I will be able to get a job in the IT field...
      </h3>
      <h2 class="aboutmeh2">Gaming</h2>
      <h3 class="aboutmeh3">I love racing and Nintendo games. There's a whole ton of more indie games and smaller gimmicky games I love to play too.
      My favorite game of all time would have to be Rocket League because I have the most hours in that and I won a highschool tournament for it.
      Although I would love to be much better at the game one day. I definitely love collecting achievements and 100% completing games.
      Maybe I will get into the more rpg style games one day. Even though I love consoles, pc will always be my favorite platform to play on.
      I love to speedrun games as well, and get really good at whatever game it is. I am also into board and card games as well. Whether classic
      or more modern of either I enjoy. I make content of these games on YouTube as well. I stream too even though I'm not super great at either
      of those things.</h3>
      <h2 class="aboutmeh2">Music</h2>
      <h3 class="aboutmeh3">I like a lot of different genres of music, but my favorite is EDM. EDM has a lot of sub-genres and my favorite of those would be trap and drum'n'bass.
        I love the monstercat label a lot and NCS is cool too. My favorite music artist of all-time is Aero Chord.</h3>
      <h2 class="aboutmeh2">Gaming Timeline</h2>
